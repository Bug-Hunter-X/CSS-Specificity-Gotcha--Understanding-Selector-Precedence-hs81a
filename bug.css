The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon error related to the specificity of CSS selectors:

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

.class-name div {
  color: red;
}

#id-name div {
  color: green;
}

#id-name .class-name div {
  color: purple;
}
```

The error lies in understanding how the browser resolves style conflicts when multiple selectors target the same element.  The last rule (`#id-name .class-name div`) has the highest specificity and will always win.  However, unexpected behavior can occur if the developer forgets to consider which selector will take precedence in the cascading order. The `#id-name .class-name div` selector is more specific than any other selector and will overwrite the rest, leading to an outcome that may not be intuitive if you don't understand CSS specificity.
