To resolve the issue, we need to be mindful of CSS specificity. It is best practice to use IDs sparingly, and to structure your CSS in a more logical and maintainable order. If you need to override a specific style, use a more specific selector with the desired properties. In this case, we can rearrange the order or use more specific selectors.

```css
/* More specific selectors should generally come before less specific ones */
#id-name .class-name div {
  color: purple;
}

#id-name div {
  color: green;
}

.class-name div {
  color: red;
}

div {
  color: blue;
}
```

By ordering selectors correctly, we ensure that the cascade effect works as intended.  Alternatively, we can use the `!important` flag, but this is generally discouraged for maintainability reasons.
